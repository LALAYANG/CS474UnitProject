You are an expert of formal method and proof generation.
For any formula $phi$, we can prove $phi$ is valid by proving that $neg phi$ is unsatisfiable.

Given a problem with informal_statement and informal_proof.
You should do the following tasks step by step:
1. Translate informal_statement into a formula $phi$, surround it with ```phi and ```.
2. Negate $phi$ to get $phi_prime = neg phi$ in Math. During this process, all the existing quantifiers should also get negated, surround it with ```phi_prime and ```.
3. Skolemize the negated formula $phi_prime$ into prenex normal form, 
namely an equisatisfiable formula which has only universal quantification. Surround it with ```skelomization and ```.
Specifically, you need to replace all $\exists y$ with a concrete and new function computing $y$ from all the arguments $y$ depends on (i.e., the universally quantified arguments that appear before $y$). 
If $y$ does not depend on any argument, you can replace it with a concrete and new constant variable.
4. Extract instantions from informal_proof as well as the ground terms in $phi_prime$ for each quantified sentence, and surround it with ```instantiations and ```.
5. For each quantified sentence in $phi_prime$, try to replace it with all the possible extracted instantion. You should get a list of quantifier-free formulas. Surround them with ```final_formula and ```.
6. After replacement, write all these quantifier-free formulas using Z3 and try to solve them using an SMT solver. If the SMT solver returns UNSAT, it means that $phi_prime$ is unsatisfiable, thereby $phi$ is valid. Surround the code with ```python and ```

For example, given the following informal_statement and informal_proof:
informal_statement: For all integers x, if x > 2, then x^2 > 4., 
informal_proof: Consider any integer x that is greater than 2. By multiplying x by itself, since x>2, the square of x (i.e., x^2) will always be greater than the square of 2, which is 4. Therefore, x^2 > 4 holds for all x>2.

Your response should be:
The informal statement "For all integers x, if x > 2, then x^2 > 4" can be formally written as:
```phi
\[ phi = \forall x \, (int(x) \to (x > 2 	o x^2 > 4)) \]
```

Negating $phi$, we perform the following transformations:
\[
\neg \forall x \, (int(x) \to (x > 2 \to x^2 > 4))
\]
This negation becomes:
```phi_prime
\[ phi_prime = \exists x \, (int(x) \land (x > 2 \land x^2 \leq 4)) \]
```

To skolemize $phi_prime$, $c$ is a new constant variable replacing $\exists x$:
```skelomization
\[ skemolization(phi_prime) = int(c) \land (c > 2 \land c^2 \leq 4) \]
```

Extract instantiations:
```instantiations
\[ x = 3 \]
```

Replace each quantified sentence with possible instantiation. 
Given our skolemized formula:
\[ int(c) and (c > 2 and c^2 <= 4) \]

using the instantiation $x = 3$, the formula becomes:
```final_formula
\[ int(3) and (3 > 2 and 3^2 <= 4) \]
```

Z3 SMT solver:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define the formula and add the instantiation x = 3
instantiation = And(
    3 > 2,         # x > 2
    3**2 <= 4      # x^2 <= 4
)

# Create a solver
solver = Solver()

# Add both the formula and instantiation
solver.add(instantiation)

# Check satisfiability
if solver.check() == unsat:
    print("UNSAT, the original statement phi is valid.")
else:
    print("SAT, the original statement phi might not be valid.")
```

Problem:
informal_statement:
When a number is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5? Show that it is 1.

informal_proof
If our number is $n$, then $n\equiv 3\pmod5$.  This tells us that  \[2n=n+n\equiv 3+3\equiv1\pmod5.\] The remainder is $1$ when the number is divided by 5.

*** Response:
The informal statement specifies a condition and a conclusion about the remainder when twice a number is divided by 5. We can translate this into a formal statement as follows:

```phi
\[ \phi = \forall n \, ((n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}) \to ((2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}))) \]
```

Negating \( \phi \) involves the following transformation:

\[
\neg \forall n \, ((n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}) \to ((2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5})))
\]

This negation becomes:

```phi_prime
\[ \phi_{\text{prime}} = \exists n \, ((n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}) \land \neg(2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5})) \]
```

To skolemize \(\phi_{\text{prime}}\), we replace \(\exists n\) with a new constant \(c\):

```skelomization
\[ \text{skemolization}(\phi_{\text{prime}}) = (c \equiv 3 \pmod{5}) \land \neg(2c \equiv 1 \pmod{5}) \]
```

Extract instantiations from the informal proof, using the ground term in \(\phi_{\text{prime}}\):

```instantiations
\[ n = 5k + 3 \, \text{(for some integer } k) \]
```

Since the informal proof uses an arbitrary example with \( n = 5k + 3 \), choose \( n = 3 \). The formula becomes:

```final_formula
\[ (3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}) \land \neg(2 \times 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}) \]
```

Now, let's solve these instantiated formulas using a Z3 SMT solver:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define a solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Create integer variable n
n = Int('n')

# Add constraints for the division by 5 and find contradiction
# Consider n = 3 because our modulus results produce n as equivalent to 3 (mod 5)
solver.add(n == 3)

# Check for unsatisfiability of the assumption.
solver.add(n % 5 == 3)  # n ≡ 3 (mod 5)
solver.add((2 * n) % 5 != 1)  # ¬(2n ≡ 1 (mod 5))

# Check satisfiability
if solver.check() == unsat:
    print("UNSAT, the original statement phi is valid.")
else:
    print("SAT, the original statement phi might not be valid.")
```

The solver should return UNSAT, confirming that the assumption \(\phi_{\text{prime}}\) leads to a contradiction, thereby proving that the original statement \(\phi\) is valid.
*** Initial result: UNSAT, the original statement phi is valid.
