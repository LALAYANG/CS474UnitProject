The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.

If $k = 2h$, then we may take $f(n) = n + h$. \n\nSuppose $f(m) = n$ with $m \\equiv n \\mod k$. Then by an easy induction on $r$ we find $f(m + kr) = n + kr$, $f(n + kr) = m + k(r+1)$. We show this leads to a contradiction. Suppose $m < n$, so $n = m + ks$ for some $s > 0$. Then $f(n) = f(m + ks) = n + ks$. But $f(n) = m + k$, so $m = n + k(s - 1) \\ge n$. Contradiction. So we must have $m \\ge n$, so $m = n + ks$ for some $s \\ge 0$. But now $f(m + k) = f(n + k(s+1)) = m + k(s + 2)$. But $f(m + k) = n + k$, so $n = m + k(s + 1) > n$. Contradiction. \n\nSo if $f(m) = n$, then $m$ and $n$ have different residues $\\pmod k$. Suppose they have $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Then the same induction shows that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$, and that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$. Hence if $m$ has a different residue $r \\mod k$, then $f(m)$ cannot have residue $r_1$ or $r_2$. For if $f(m)$ had residue $r_1$, then the same argument would show that all sufficiently large numbers with residue $r_1$ had $f(m) \\equiv r \\pmod k$.

We shall now consider when $\\cos x$ is positive. We can square the given inequality, and the resulting inequality will be true whenever the original left inequality is true. $4\\cos^2{x}\\leq 1+\\sin 2x+1-\\sin 2x-2\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2 2x}=2-2\\sqrt{\\cos^2{2x}}$. This inequality is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1-\\left| \\cos 2x\\right|$. I shall now divide this problem into cases.\n\nCase 1: $\\cos 2x$ is non-negative. This means that $x$ is in one of the intervals $[0,\\pi/4]$ or $[7\\pi/4, 2\\pi]$. We must find all $x$ in these two intervals such that $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1-\\cos 2x$. This inequality is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 2\\sin^2 x$, which is only true when $x=\\pi/4$ or $7\\pi/4$.\n\nCase 2: $\\cos 2x$ is negative. This means that $x$ is in one of the interavals $(\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$ or $(3\\pi/2, 7\\pi/4)$. We must find all $x$ in these two intervals such that $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1+\\cos 2x$, which is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 2\\cos^2 x$, which is true for all $x$ in these intervals.\n\nTherefore the left inequality is true when $x$ is in the union of the intervals $[\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$, $(3\\pi/2, 7\\pi/4]$, and $[\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2]$, which is the interval $[\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4]$. We shall now deal with the right inequality.\n\nAs above, we can square it and have it be true whenever the original right inequality is true, so we do that. $2-2\\sqrt{\\cos^2{2x}}\\leq 2$, which is always true. Therefore the original right inequality is always satisfied, and all $x$ such that the original inequality is satisfied are in the interval $[\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4]$.\n\n    Your response:\n", "response": "```instantiations\n1.

Thus, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{\\gcd(9999,100001)},$$so we focus on computing $\\gcd(9999,100001)$.\n\nNotice that $100001 = 99990+11 = 10(9999)+11$. Therefore, any common divisor of $100001$ and $9999$ must be a divisor of $100001-10\\cdot 9999 = 11$. The possibilities are $1$ and $11$.\n\nIn fact, $9999=11\\cdot 909$, so $11$ is a divisor of $9999$ and $100001$, which gives $\\gcd(9999,100001) = 11$.\n\nTherefore, \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] &= \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{11} \\\\\n&= 909\\cdot 100001 \\\\\n&= 909\\cdot 100000 + 909 \\\\\n&= 90{,}900{,}909.\n\\end{align*}\n\n    Your response:\n", "response": "```instantiations\n\\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab\\)\n\\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{\\gcd(9999,100001)}\\)\n\\(100001 = 10 \\cdot 9999 + 11\\)\n\\(\\gcd(9999,100001) = 11\\)\n\\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{11} = 90,900,909\\)\n```\n\n```formal_proof\n1.

To find \\(\\gcd(9999,100001)\\), note that \\(100001 = 10 \\cdot 9999 + 11\\).\n3. Any common divisor of \\(100001\\) and \\(9999\\) must also divide \\(11\\), so the possible divisors are \\(1\\) and \\(11\\).\n4. Since \\(9999 = 11 \\cdot 909\\), \\(11\\) is a divisor of both \\(9999\\) and \\(100001\\), thus \\(\\gcd(9999,100001) = 11\\).\n5. Substituting back, \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{11}\\).\n6. Calculating, \\(\\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{11} = 909 \\cdot 100001 = 909 \\cdot 100000 + 909 = 90,900,909\\).\n7.

Consider the congruence 10 \u2261 -1 (mod 11). This means that 10 and -1 have the same remainder when divided by 11.\n2. For any natural number n, raise both sides of the congruence to the power of n: 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n (mod 11). This follows from the properties of congruences, specifically that if a \u2261 b (mod m), then a^n \u2261 b^n (mod m) for any natural number n.\n3. Therefore, 10^n - (-1)^n is divisible by 11 for any natural number n, as 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n (mod 11) implies 10^n - (-1)^n \u2261 0 (mod 11).\n4.

Prove that if $a+d=2^k$ and $b+c=2^m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$, then $a=1$.\n\n    informal_proof\n    Let $f:[1,b]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\ f(x)=x+\\dfrac{bc}{x}$. As $f^\\prime (x)=1-\\dfrac{bc}{x^2}\\le 0$, we infer that $f(x)\\ge f(b)=b+c,\\ \\forall x\\in [1,b]$; in particular, $a+d=f(a)\\ge b+c\\Leftrightarrow k\\ge m$.\n\nNow, $ad=bc\\Leftrightarrow a(2^k-a)=b(2^m-b)\\Leftrightarrow (b-a)(a+b)=2^m(b-2^{k-m}a)$, hence $2^m|(b-a)(a+b)$. It is easy to see that for $x,y\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, if $v_2(x\\pm y)\\ge 2$, then $v_2(x\\mp y)=1$. If $v_2(b-a)\\ge 2$, $v_2(a+b)=1$, so $v_2(b-a)\\ge m-1\\Rightarrow b>2^{m-1}$, which is in contradiction with the fact that $b<\\dfrac{b+c}{2}=2^{m-1}$. Thereby, $v_2(a+b)\\ge m-1,\\ v_2(b-a)=1$.\n\nWrite $a+b=2^{m-1}\\alpha$. If $\\alpha \\ge 2\\Rightarrow2^m\\le a+b<b+c=2^m$, contradiction; so $a+b=2^{m-1}$ and $b-a=2\\beta$, or equivalently $a=2^{m-2}-\\beta,\\ b=2^{m-2}+\\beta$ ( $m>2$ otherwise $b+c=2\\Leftrightarrow b=c=1$ or $b+c=4\\Leftrightarrow c=3,b=1\\Rightarrow a=0$ , contradiction )\n\n\nSubstituting back, $(b-a)(a+b)=2^m(b-2^{k-m}a)\\Leftrightarrow 2^m\\beta=2^m(2^{m-2}+\\beta-2^{k-m}a)\\Leftrightarrow 2^{k-m}a=2^{m-2}$\n\nAs $m>2$ and $a$ is odd, we get that $a=1$. Furthermore, $k=2m-2$, hence $d=2^{2m-2}-1$. Now $b(2^m-b)=2^{2m-2}-1\\Leftrightarrow \\left ( b-(2^{m-1}-1) \\right ) \\left ( b-(2^{m-1}+1)\\right )=0$ which together with the fact that $b<c$, we get that $b=2^{m-1}-1,\\ c=2^{m-1}+1$, so the family of the solutions $(a,b,c,d)$ is described by the set\n$ M=\\{ \\left (1,2^{m-1}-1,2^{m-1}+1,2^{2m-2}-1 \\right )|\\ m\\in \\mathbb{N},m\\ge 3 \\}$\n\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by TheFunkyRabbit. The original thread for this problem can be found here: [https://aops.com/community/p4908989]\n\n    Your response:\n", "response": "To address the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Extract Instantiations\n\nFrom the informal proof, we can extract the following instantiations:\n\n```instantiations\na, b, c, d are odd integers\n0 < a < b < c < d\nad = bc\na + d = 2^k\nb + c = 2^m\n```\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Formal Proof\n\nUsing the extracted instantiations, we can construct a formal proof:\n\n```formal_proof\n1. Let a, b, c, d be odd integers such that 0 < a < b < c < d and ad = bc.\n2. Assume a + d = 2^k and b + c = 2^m for some integers k and m.\n3. Define the function f(x) = x + bc/x for x in [1, b]. The derivative f'(x) = 1 - bc/x^2 is non-positive, indicating f is non-increasing.\n4. Therefore, f(a) \u2265 f(b) = b + c, implying a + d \u2265 b + c, or k \u2265 m.\n5. From ad = bc, we have a(2^k - a) = b(2^m - b), leading to (b - a)(a + b) = 2^m(b - 2^(k-m)a).\n6. Thus, 2^m divides (b - a)(a + b). If v_2(b - a) \u2265 2, then v_2(a + b) = 1, leading to a contradiction with b < (b + c)/2 = 2^(m-1).\n7. Therefore, v_2(a + b) \u2265 m - 1 and v_2(b - a) = 1.\n8. Let a + b = 2^(m-1)\u03b1. If \u03b1 \u2265 2, then 2^m \u2264 a + b < b + c = 2^m, a contradiction. Thus, a + b = 2^(m-1) and b - a = 2\u03b2.\n9. This implies a = 2^(m-2) - \u03b2 and b = 2^(m-2) + \u03b2, with m > 2.\n10. Substituting back, we find 2^(k-m)a = 2^(m-2), and since a is odd, a = 1.\n11. Therefore, a = 1, and the family of solutions is described by the set M = { (1, 2^(m-1) - 1, 2^(m-1) + 1, 2^(2m-2) - 1) | m \u2208 \u2115, m \u2265 3 }.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Formal Proof using Python Z3\n\nNow, let's write the formal proof using Python Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import Int, Solver, And, Or, Not, sat\n\n# Define variables\na, b, c, d, k, m = Int('a'), Int('b'), Int('c'), Int('d'), Int('k'), Int('m')\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Add constraints based on the problem statement\nsolver.add(a > 0, a < b, b < c, c < d)  # 0 < a < b < c < d\nsolver.add(a * d == b * c)  # ad = bc\nsolver.add(a + d == 2**k)  # a + d = 2^k\nsolver.add(b + c == 2**m)  # b + c = 2^m\nsolver.add(a % 2 == 1, b % 2 == 1, c % 2 == 1, d % 2 == 1)  # a, b, c, d are odd\n\n# Check if a = 1 is a solution\nsolver.add(a != 1)\n\n# Check for satisfiability\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    print(\"A counterexample exists:\", solver.model())\nelse:\n    print(\"No counterexample exists.

Note that:\n\n(a) $\\displaystyle x_n<x_{n+1} \\Leftrightarrow x_n>1-\\frac{1}{n} \\Leftrightarrow P_n^{-1}(x_n)>P_n^{-1}(1-\\frac{1}{n}) \\Leftrightarrow x_1>a_n$;\n(b) $\\displaystyle x_n<1 \\Leftrightarrow P_n^{-1}(x_n)<P_n^{-1}(1) \\Leftrightarrow x_1<b_n$.\n\nThus, $0<x_n<x_{n+1}<1,\\forall n$ holds if and only if $a_n<x_1<b_n,\\forall n$, or $\\displaystyle x_1 \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^{+\\infty}(a_n,b_n)$. We need to show that $\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{n=1}^{+\\infty}(a_n,b_n)$ is a singleton.

It follows that $a_n<a_{n+1},\\forall n$; and\n(d) if $x_1=b_n$, then $x_n=1$, which implies that $x_{n+1}=1+\\frac{1}{n}>1=P_{n+1}(b_{n+1})$, and $x_1>b_{n+1}$. It follows that $b_n>b_{n+1},\\forall n$; and\n\nThus, $a_n<a_{n+1}<b_{n+1}<b_n, \\forall n$.
